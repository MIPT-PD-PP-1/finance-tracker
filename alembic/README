# Alembic setup for this project

## What I added
- `alembic/` with `env.py` preconfigured to import your SQLAlchemy Base.
- `alembic/versions/202511101800_29ea10_initial.py` as a placeholder initial migration.
- `alembic.ini` with detected DB URL: `sqlite:///./app.db`.

## How to use locally
1) Create/activate your virtualenv and install requirements (ensure `alembic` and `sqlalchemy` are installed).
2) Check that `alembic/env.py` correctly imports your `Base`. If not, set `target_metadata` manually.
3) (Recommended) Recreate an autogeneration-based migration from your models:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"
   ```
   Delete the placeholder migration I created and use the autogen file instead.
4) Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
